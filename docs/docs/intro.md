# Fundamentals of Data Engineering

Welcome to this comprehensive guide based on the book **"Fundamentals of Data Engineering"** by Joe Reis and Matt Housley. This guide transforms complex data engineering concepts into learnable, practical knowledge.

## What You'll Learn

Data engineering is the development, implementation, and maintenance of systems and processes that take in raw data and produce high-quality, consistent information that supports downstream use cases, such as analysis and machine learning.

### Part I: Foundation and Building Blocks

| Chapter | Topic | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | [Data Engineering Described](./chapter1) | What is data engineering, who data engineers work with, and the evolution of the field |
| 2 | [The Data Engineering Lifecycle](./chapter2) | The five stages: Generation → Storage → Ingestion → Transformation → Serving |
| 3 | [Designing Good Data Architecture](./chapter3) | Principles of good architecture, batch vs streaming, and modern patterns |
| 4 | [Choosing Technologies](./chapter4) | How to evaluate and select the right tools for your data stack |

### Part II: The Data Engineering Lifecycle in Depth

| Chapter | Topic | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| 5 | [Data Generation in Source Systems](./chapter5) | Understanding source systems, databases, APIs, and data formats |
| 6 | [Storage](./chapter6) | Storage abstractions, data lakes, and storage systems |
| 7 | [Ingestion](./chapter7) | Batch vs streaming ingestion, CDC, and data integration |
| 8 | [Queries, Modeling, and Transformation](./chapter8) | SQL, data modeling, and transformation patterns |
| 9 | [Serving Data](./chapter9) | Analytics, ML, and reverse ETL |

### Part III: Security, Privacy, and the Future

| Chapter | Topic | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| 10 | [Security and Privacy](./chapter10) | Security practices, encryption, and data privacy |
| 11 | [The Future of Data Engineering](./chapter11) | Emerging trends and the evolving landscape |

## The Data Engineering Lifecycle

The central framework of this book is the **data engineering lifecycle**, which consists of five stages:

```
Generation → Storage → Ingestion → Transformation → Serving
```

Alongside these stages are **undercurrents** that span the entire lifecycle:
- **Security** - Protecting data and systems
- **Data Management** - Governance, quality, and metadata
- **DataOps** - Automation, monitoring, and incident response
- **Data Architecture** - Designing robust systems
- **Orchestration** - Coordinating workflows
- **Software Engineering** - Building maintainable code

## Who This Guide Is For

- **Aspiring Data Engineers** looking to understand the fundamentals
- **Software Engineers** transitioning into data roles
- **Data Scientists** who want to understand the systems they depend on
- **Technical Leaders** making architecture and tool decisions

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Sequential Reading**: The chapters build on each other, so reading in order is recommended
2. **Reference**: Use the table of contents to jump to specific topics
3. **Practice**: Apply concepts to your own projects as you learn
